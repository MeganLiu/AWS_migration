(2) migration exsiting Domains or add new subdomains for new deployed AWS services
Creating a Subdomain That Uses Amazon Route 53 as the DNS Service without Migrating the Parent Domain

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/route53-dg.pdf#CreatingNewSubdomain
The process has four basic steps:

(a)Create a Route 53 hosted zone for the subdomain.

(b)Add records for the new subdomain to your Route 53 hosted zone.

(c)API only: Confirm that your changes have propagated to all Route 53 DNS servers.

Note

Currently, the only way to verify that changes have propagated is to use the GetChange API action. Changes generally propagate to all Route 53 name servers within 60 seconds.

(d)Update the DNS service for the parent domain by adding name server records for the subdomain.
